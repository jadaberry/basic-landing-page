# basic-landing-page

This is a sample landing page for a fake honey production company called Sweet Sting. This landing page implements only HTML/CSS and includes semantic HTML elements. 

Note: this is only a landing-page. Clicking navigational links and buttons is not a feature in this project, as it is not a full-site.
