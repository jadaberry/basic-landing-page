                <blockquote>"I was a bit hesitant at first to switch from my regular grocery store brand honey. I use honey on a daily-basis, so if I got honey that wasn't good it would totally ruin my daily routine. Maybe it's a little dramatic to say, but this honey has changed my life. My body feels so much lighter and well-taken care of. So much so, that this is now the only honey I allow my kids to have! Thank you Sweet Sting for your dedication. It tastes GREAT!!!"</blockquote>
